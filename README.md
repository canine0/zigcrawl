# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: Zigcrawl

Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a game of dungeon exploration, combat and magic, involving characters of diverse skills, worshipping deities of great power and caprice. To win, you'll need to be a master of tactics and strategy, and prevail against overwhelming odds.

Zigcrawl is a fork mostly focused around adding dumb and broken things, but does have a few serious goals:
* Make ziggurats and megazigging more dangerous and interesting, and incentivize ziggurat-diving more (this is the main goal and namesake)
* Add some novelty spells, items, and races, both dumb ones and interesting ones
* Expand the lore of Crawl (readable journals, expanded flavor, and new vaults TBA)
* Add some old things back in, for better or for worse
